## Problem 1
465 distinct stations
84 stations that are ADA compliant
37.8% (no vending upon entry)
60 stations on A line
17 stations on A line that are ADA compliant 

The data set has 20 variables and 239 observations. I imported the CSV file and cleaned the data. I got rid of some unnecessary variables and reduced it to 10 variables. Then I modified the entry variable state if entry was possible at that location or not. To answer the various questions I filtered by the characteristics mentioned.

## Problem 2
The combined data set has 94 observations. Key variables include weight of trash collected, dumpster number, how many of a specific item were collected, and when it was collected.

Professor Trash Wheel collected a total of 190.12 tons of trash

In 2020, a total of 856 sports balls were collected by Mr. Trash Wheel.

## Problem 3
Pols_month data set:after combing the president variable, it had 9 variables - year, president, republican and democratic governors/senators/and representatives. 4 variables once modified - year, day, month, and close. The prez_gop variable, which should only have values 0 and 1 has some values of 2 - unclear why that it. 

SNP data set: has 4 variables - month, year, day, and S&P closing values of that day. 

Unemployment data set: has 13 variables (year and each month). the values correspond to the unemployment rate during that time.

Upon completion, the table was 822 by 15--15 variables and 822 observations (once NAs dropped, with NA's there are 9,696 observations) Years range from 1947 to 2015 and key variables include: year, president, S&P closing stock values, and unemployment rate
